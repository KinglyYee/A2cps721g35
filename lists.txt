1. [mth110 | [mth210 | [cps305 | [cps721 | CPS822 ]]]] and [P,R,Q | AI]


Let
mth110 = P

Converting out of head | tail notation
[cps721 | CPS822] = [cps721, CPS822]

cps305 | [cps721, CPS822] can be rewritten as
Q = cps305
AI = [cps721, CPS822]
Therefore, 
[Q | AI]

Let mth210 = R, extending further we can substitute

[mth210 | Q | AI]
[R | Q | AI]

Finally,
Let mth110 = P

[mth110 | R | Q | AI]
[P | R | Q | AI]

By head tail notation, this is equivalent to 
[P, R ,Q | AI]

Therefore LHS = RHS
QED

2. [List | [List, a,b,c]] and [[], Z | U]

Let List = []
[ List, List, a, b ,c] 



[]

[ [] | [ [], a,b,c] ]

[ [] , [], a, b, c ]



  
3. [U,[W|U],a,b] and [Z | [ [a|[b] | W]]

[Z | [ [a|[b] | W]]
= [ Z | [a,b] | W ]
= [ Z | [a,b], W]
= [ Z, [ [a,b], W] ]
= [ Z, [ [a,b], W] ]

[U,[W|U],a,b]
Let Z = U
[ Z, [W|Z], a, b]
[ Z, [ W,Z ], a , b]

RHS = 2 elements
LHS = 3 elements


4. [ Var | U ] and [ http, www | [ryerson, ca]]
[ http, [www, ryerson, ca ]]

Let
[www, ryerson, ca] = U
http = Var

[ http | U ]
[ Var | U] 

Therefore, identical 
QED



5.
[k,p | U] and [k, W, m,n, [W | [c]]]


[k, W, m, n, [W | [c]]]
[ k, W, m ,n, [W,c] ]
[ k, W, m, n, [W,c] ]

let W = p
[ k, p, m, n, [p,c] ]


let [ m,n,[p,c] ] = U

by head tail notation,
[k, p | [ m, n, [p,c] ] ]
[k, p | U]

QED

6. [ U | W] and [W | [[]| U]]

[ W | [] ]
is equivaent to W 

Therefore,
[W | [[]| U]]
= [ W | U]

and that's the same as
[ U | W]

QED

7.[myself, Q | [ P | U ] ] and [ W | [ [vars | [ P ] ] | [ myself | Q ] ] ]

[ myself, Q | [ P, U ] ]
[ myself, Q, P, U ]

[ W | [ [vars | [ P ] ] | [ myself | Q ] ] ]
[ W | [ [ vars, P]] | [ myself, Q]]
[ W | [ [ vars, P]] | [myself , Q]]
[ W | [ [ vars, P], myself, Q ] ]
[ W , [ vars, p ], myself, Q]

let [ vars, p] = P 
[ W, P, myself, Q]

now we let W = U
[ U, P, myself, Q]
which reordered is
[ myself, Q, P, U]

QED

8.  
[k, [Q | [l,m]], tree | [book | Z]]  and  [P, U | [R,Q,n]] 
[k, [Q | [l,m]], tree | [book | Z]]
[k, [Q, l, m], tree | [book, Z]]
[k, [Q, l, m], tree, book, Z]


[P, U | [R,Q,n]]
